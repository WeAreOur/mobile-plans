# Affiliate Links & Transparency

## Our Approach

This site uses **passive affiliate links** to support our mission of providing free, unbiased mobile plan comparison data.

## What This Means

### What We Do
✅ Show all plans equally - no hidden agenda  
✅ Let you filter and sort however you want  
✅ Provide transparent, community-verified data  
✅ Add optional affiliate links for convenience  
✅ Clearly mark all affiliate links with a badge (*)

### What We DON'T Do
❌ Recommend specific plans  
❌ Hide or prioritize plans based on commissions  
❌ Manipulate data or rankings  
❌ Charge you any extra fees  
❌ Share your data with providers

## How It Works

1. **You browse plans** - All data shown equally, no bias
2. **You decide** - Filter, sort, and choose based on your needs
3. **You click "View Plan"** - We provide a tracked link to the provider
4. **You may sign up** - If you do, we might earn a small commission
5. **No extra cost to you** - The commission comes from the provider's marketing budget

## The Value Exchange

- **You get**: Accurate comparison data + convenient one-click access
- **We get**: A small commission if you sign up (at no cost to you)
- **Provider gets**: A customer who made an informed decision

Everyone wins, with complete transparency.

## Data Integrity

Our affiliate program is designed to **never compromise data quality**:

- All plan data is **community-contributed and verified**
- We display **all available plans**, regardless of affiliate status
- Plans **without affiliate links** are shown equally
- Our **filtering/sorting** is based purely on plan features, not commissions
- Community members can **challenge any data** through GitHub

## Financial Transparency

### Revenue Model
- Affiliate commissions (when users sign up via our links)
- No advertising
- No sponsored placements
- No data selling

### What We Fund
- Hosting and infrastructure costs
- Domain registration
- Development time for improvements
- Community initiatives and documentation

## Your Privacy

We add UTM tracking parameters to links for analytics purposes:
- `utm_source=weareour-mobile-plans`
- `utm_medium=referral`
- `utm_campaign=plan-comparison`
- `utm_content=[provider]-[plan-name]`

These help us understand which plans are popular, but **we do not track individual users** or share any personal data.

## Alternative Access

1. Copy the provider name
2. Search for them directly
3. Find the plan yourself

We respect your choice and appreciate you using our comparison data!
