# Mobile Plans Community Charter

## Mission

To provide accurate, timely, community-verified mobile plan data, free from commercial influence and accessible to everyone.

## Vision

A world where consumers can make informed decisions about mobile plans based on transparent, trustworthy, community-maintained data.

## Core Principles

### 1. Open Data
All data is licensed under CC-BY-SA 4.0, ensuring it remains free and open forever.

### 2. Community Governance
Major decisions are made collectively by the community, not by any single entity or company.

### 3. Transparency
All changes are tracked in Git. All decisions are documented. All discussions are public.

### 4. No Commercial Bias
- No affiliate links in core data
- Providers cannot pay for better placement
- All plans are treated equally

### 5. Quality Over Quantity
We prioritize accurate, verified data over comprehensive but unreliable data.

### 6. Provider Participation
Providers are welcome to maintain their own data, but community verification is always required.

## What Success Looks Like

When a provider updates their website:
1. Within 24 hours, the community has detected it
2. Within 48 hours, the data is updated
3. Within 72 hours, the provider has verified it
4. Consumers immediately see accurate information

## Values

- **Accuracy**: We verify before we publish
- **Accessibility**: Available to everyone, everywhere
- **Collaboration**: Community-driven, not top-down
- **Integrity**: Resistant to manipulation and bias
- **Sustainability**: Built to last decades, not months

## Governance

### Roles

**Contributors**: Anyone who submits data
**Trusted Contributors**: Proven track record, can review PRs
**Maintainers**: Merge PRs, resolve disputes, set policy
**Providers**: Verified company accounts

### Decision Making

- **Data disputes**: Resolved by evidence and consensus
- **Policy changes**: Discussed publicly, approved by maintainers
- **Technical changes**: PRs reviewed by maintainers
- **Major decisions**: Community RFC (Request for Comments) process

### Conflict Resolution

1. Open a GitHub issue
2. Present evidence
3. Community discussion (7 days minimum)
4. Maintainer decision based on charter principles
5. Decision is documented and can be appealed
